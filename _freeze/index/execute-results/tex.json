A recent BBC interview with Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang, for example, highlighted this as a factor behind his decision to relocate the capital city:\n\n> It's the remoteness of Oyala that makes it so appealing to President Obiang. In a rare interview he described how rebels had recently plotted a seaborne assault on his palace in the current capital, Malabo. 'We need a secure place for my government and for future governments. That's why we have created Oyala, to guarantee the government of Equatorial Guinea.' [@sackur_equatorial_2012]\n\nThis case is far from exceptional, as an even more recent *Washington Post* article points out with respect to Myanmar's decision to move its capital from Yangon to Naypyidaw:\n\n> Analysts have described the decision as motivated by a desire to secure the militaryâ€™s seat of power from any threat of protests or invasions. [@berger_myanmars_2021]\n\nMost of these studies, however, are based on observations of **conflict events**. In this study, we study the more fundamental variable of a capital's distance from the **population centroid** of the country.\n\n## Literature Review\n\n@campante_capital_2019 analyzes the relationship between the location of a **capital city** and the degree of conflict and misgovernance in a given country. Their two key findings are that:\n\n> Conflict is more likely to emerge (and dislodge incumbents) closer to the capital\n\nand\n\n> Isolated capitals are associated with misgovernance.\n\nThis first finding is illustrated in @fig-conflict-dist\n\n![](images/conflict_dist.svg){#fig-conflict-dist}\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe **population centroids** we use herein might require some explanation, since the term \"centroid\" can be ambiguous.\n\nHere, the population centroids are drawn from @hall_population_2019\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nHere we plot the base GIS objects we're analyzing: the location of each **capital city** (in purple) and each **population centroid** (in yellow).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(tidyverse) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(sf) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(mapview) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(units) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\ncb_palette <- c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur evidence indicates that the spatial dynamics of **conflict** differ from the spatial dynamics of **misgovernance**.
