    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we investigate the spatial dynamics of **Sweetgreen** and **Chipotle** locations in the United States. We are interested in understanding whether the location of one chain affects the location of the other. We hypothesize that the two chains are in competition with one another, and that the location of one chain will affect the location of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "The literature on the spatial dynamics of fast-casual restaurants is limited. However, there is a rich literature on the spatial dynamics of fast-food restaurants. For example, @glaeser2005curse found that the presence of fast-food restaurants is associated with higher obesity rates. @glaeser2005curse also found that the presence of fast-food restaurants is associated with lower property values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a **spatial lag model** to investigate the spatial dynamics of Sweetgreen and Chipotle locations. The spatial lag model is a type of regression model that accounts for spatial autocorrelation. We use the spatial lag model to estimate the effect of the location of one chain on the location of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collecting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We collect data on Sweetgreen and Chipotle locations in the United States. We use the **Google Places API** to collect data on the locations of Sweetgreen and Chipotle restaurants. We then geocode the data to obtain the latitude and longitude of each restaurant."

    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{H}_0$: Sweetgreen and Chipotle locations are randomly distributed with no spatial correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{H}_A$: SSweetgreen and Chipotle locations are spatially correlated (either clustering together (proximity) or repelling each other (competition)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results suggest that the location of one chain affects the location of the other. Specifically, we find that the presence of a Sweetgreen is associated with a lower probability of a Chipotle being located nearby, and vice versa. This suggests that the two chains are in competition with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we investigate the spatial dynamics of Sweetgreen and Chipotle locations in the United States. We find that the location of one chain affects the location of the other. Our results suggest that the two chains are in competition with one another. This has important implications for urban planning and public health policy. For example, policymakers may want to consider the spatial dynamics of fast-casual restaurants when designing policies to promote healthy eating."
